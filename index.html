      <h3>Claim</h3>
      <p>The Mystery Black Box contains a tubing system with curves for water to both flow through and get caught in different bends and loops.</p>
      <h3>Evidence</h3>
      <p>The Mystery Black Box is a sealed container with an internal structure that allows water to flow through, but often causes the output amount of water to differ significantly from the input amount of water. We initially observed that the water that flowed out of Mystery Black Box could be either much more or much less water than the input value of water, and varied from trial to trial. Using these observations, we designed and built a model of what we believed to be a plausible explanation of the internal structure of the Mystery Black Box. Our model included a system of connected tubes that we bent and taped to form curves and loops inside a scaled-down version of the Mystery Black Box. To collect data, we performed a total of 30 trials with varying amounts and colors of water to understand how water flowed through the tubing system of our model of the Mystery Black Box. After pouring the water in our model, we then measured the resulting amount of water after water stopped flowing through the tubing system. Similar to the real Mystery Black Box, some of our trials resulted in an output of more water (for example, Trial 12, in which 100 mL of water was poured into the system and 105 mL flowed out), while some resulted in an output of less (Trial 16, when 385 mL flowed out of the system after 400 mL was poured in). Additionally, some of our trials had no increase  or decrease between the input and output amounts of water (such as Trials 13 and 14), and our first trial had an output flow of 0 mL. We also noted that when testing with different colors of water, the color of the input water and the output water would often differ. For example, when we poured in dark red water, lighter red water would come out. Alternatively, if clear water was poured in, bright red water would come out.</p>
      <h3>Reasoning, Part 1</h3>
      <p>A model is a scaled representation of a system or object that is often used to examine a real object or system. Models can be helpful to test a system on a smaller scale, or to examine an object on a larger scale for more detail. However, models cannot always perfectly represent their real-world counterpart, and they may be limited by lessened functionality when they are scaled differently from the original object.</p>
      <h3>Reasoning, Part 2</h3>
      <p>Our evidence supports the claim that weâ€™ve made, that the internal structure of the Mystery Black Box is a winding system of tubes, as our collected data reflects what would likely result from a smaller version of the Mystery Black Box. We collected data of the output water that was both greater than, lesser than, and equal to the amount of input water, demonstrating a similar pattern to the real Mystery Black Box. </p>
      <h3>Reasoning, Part 3</h3>
      <p>Had the Mystery Black Box been any other internal system, the output amounts of water would not have varied between lesser than, equal to, or greater than the initial amount of water poured in. Our data reflects how water moves and gets stuck in curves of the tubing system of the box, which would not have been possible with a different system. For example, if a system involving a sponge was used, the Mystery Black Box would produce water every time after the first trial, as the sponge would never be dry and would consistently leak. While there could be a variation in how the tubing system is structured, our data reflects the most feasible internal system of the Mystery Black Box.</p>
